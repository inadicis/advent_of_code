# Advent Of Code 2023

Personal repository, collection of the scripts I wrote to solve the challenges of adventofcode.com.

## 2023 [Python + Golang]

First time I try AOC. My goal is to complete both parts of every day, while learning a new language: **_Go_**. I do not try to complete them as fast as possible, instead, I try to write re-usable (with other inputs matching problem description) and understandable code for the given problem (often with automated tests). Because of this goal of "reusability no matter the input", I try not to abuse the "niceness" of given input -> I try to handle edge cases even it my input does not need it.
